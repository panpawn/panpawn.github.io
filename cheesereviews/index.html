        <p>Hello, welcome to Jaden Walker's cheese reviews! Jaden has made it his lifes mission to finding the best cheeses and a ranking structure to judge them. Now he's ready to share them with you!</p>
        <h1>Ranking Structure</h1>
        <ul>
		<li><u>Appearance (/5)</u>: If something doesn't look edible, why would anyone want to eat it? Cheese comes in all different shapes and sizes, colors and presentations. As such, appearance will constitute towards rank.</li>
        <li><u>Texture (/10)</u>: Many people hate onions because of how slimey they taste. Jaden hates onions. Fuck onions. If any cheese has a texture like an onion, it will get a 0 in this category.</li>
		<li><u>Smell (/5)</u>: You know that smell a dishwasher inevitably gets where it smells like dead fish, but you never even put fish in it? If any cheese tastes like dead fish, I swear to god I'll puke and then give it a 0 in this category.</li>
		<li><u>Taste (/15)</u>: Some people say something is "cheesey", but they mean that as a term of endearment. This category literally judges how much cheese tastes like cheese, you'd think it'd be hard to fuck this one up but you'll be surprised.</li>
        </ul>
		<br />
        <h1>Top Reviews</h1>
        <ul>
        <li><u>Anthony's Pizza (Pizza, mozzarella) (8/35)</u>: <br />
		<i>Appearance (1/5):</i> Maybe they didn't cook the pizza long enough, but the cheese isn't even melted. Like who even does that? If I wanted unmelted cheese I'd go scoop some out of a bag from the grocery store that has enough preservatives for years.<br />
		<i>Texture (3/10):</i> This would be a 1 if not for the few parts of the edges that were actually melted. <br />
		<i>Smell (1/5):</i> It smelt like unmelted mozzarella, so nothing really special.<br />
		<i>Taste (3/15):</i> Pretty below average, mostly due to not being melted. Nothing to really write home about. 
		</li>
        <li><u>Burg's Burger Emporium (Burger, cheddar) (33/35)</u>: <br />
		<i>Appearance (8/5):</i> Finally, cheese that is properly melted and even has a nice light sear around the edges but no air bubbles.<br />
		<i>Texture (9/10):</i> The texture of cheddar atop a burger without being too melted or not melted enough is always good to see.<br />
		<i>Smell (4/5):</i> The smell complimented the burger well but was not overpowering.<br />
		<i>Taste (12/15):</i> Quality slab of cheese is always a nice snack. Tasted fresh without being *too* fresh.
		</li>
		</ul>
       <p><u>Message from Jaden Walker:</u><br />
	   Thank you for being as big of a cheese fan as myself. I hope you enjoyed learning about my cheesey journey and I hope it's inspired you in some way. Due to new job oppertunities, unfortunately my cheesey journey has come to an end. I encourage those as passionate of cheese as myself to start their own cheesey journey.</p>

       <p id="question">Anyways, enough about cheese. How is your day going so far?</p>
