    <p>Bacon is defined as: cured meat from the sides and belly of a pig, having distinct strips of fat and typically served in thin slices.</p>
    <p>According to Wikipedia: Bacon is a meat product prepared from pork and usually cured. It is first cured using large quantities of salt, either in a brine or in a dry packing; the result is fresh bacon (also known as green bacon).

Boiled bacon is ready to eat, as is some smoked bacon, but may be cooked further before eating.</p>
